Trying to run Caffe on EC2
Would be shorter if we had used Anaconda
Did not get CUDA to work (could not apply driver)

To use:
 1) Start an EC2 instance
 2) Copy contents of this repository onto instance ( git clone https://github.com/JohnMount/CaffeECSExample.git )
 3) Follow the many steps in steps.txt
